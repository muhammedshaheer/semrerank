{"id": "3247246","title": "Security Breaches","body": "It has been claimed that many security breaches are often caused by vulnerable ( naive ) employees within the organization. Thus, the weakest link in security is often not the technology itself but rather the people who use it. The risky behavior of users is likely to emerge in cases where the users do not fully understand the potential risk consequences of their actions, such as browsing risky webpages. A machine learning scheme for detecting risky web pages and risky browsing behaviour, performed by naive users in the organization, which analyzes the interaction between two modules: one represent naive users, while the other represents risky web pages is used. A feedback loop between these modules works such that if a webpage is exposed to a lot of traffic from risky users, its “risk score” increases, while in a similar manner, as the user is exposed to risky web pages(with a high “risk score”), his own “risk score” increases. The scheme is tested on a real world dataset of HTTP logs from a large American  company. The results suggest that a feedback learning process  can improve the scoring accuracy and lead to the detection of unknown malicious web pages.","accepted_answer_id": "3247526","answer_count": "2","comment_count": "0","creation_date": "2010-07-14 14:39:48.053 UTC","last_activity_date": "2010-07-14 16:02:19.683 UTC","last_edit_date": "2010-07-14 15:56:37.803 UTC","last_editor_display_name": "","last_editor_user_id": "70604","owner_display_name": "","owner_user_id": "389430","post_type_id": "1","score": "2","tags": "eclipse|maven-2|tomcat|m2eclipse","view_count": "1653"}
